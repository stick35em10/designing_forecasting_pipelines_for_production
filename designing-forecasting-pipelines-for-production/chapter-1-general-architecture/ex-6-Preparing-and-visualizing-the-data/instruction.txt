Preparing and visualizing the data
Accurate data preparation is key to building effective machine learning models. Now it's time to apply the skills you've learned.

Your data needs three columns for the statsforecast library:

unique_id: series ID
ds: series timestamp
y: series values
Apply the necessary steps to clean and reformat your data for time series forecasting. The dataset has been preloaded as ts, and pandas is imported as pd.

Instructions 1/3
    Convert the "period" column to a datetime format and sort the DataFrame by "period" in ascending order.


Instructions 2/3
    Rename the "period" column to "ds" and the "value" column to "y".
    Add a new column called "unique_id" and set its value to 1 (since you are working with a single time series).
